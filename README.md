## Introduction

Fraud detection in online payments is critical for financial security. D-Fraudify provides a comprehensive framework that integrates machine learning models with a user-friendly interface for detecting fraudulent transactions. With real-world datasets and efficient algorithms, the project ensures accuracy and scalability.

---

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes a trained Decision Tree model (`dtmodel.pkl`).
- **User Interface**: A Python-based user interface (`ui.py`) for easy interaction.
- **Notebook for Exploration**: An interactive Jupyter notebook for exploring fraud detection strategies.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Ready-to-use fraud detection model.
- **Open Source**: Fully customizable and extendable for further enhancements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gp0814/D-Fraudify.git
    cd D-Fraudify
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) Run the application locally:
    ```bash
    python ui.py
    ```

---

## Usage

1. **Interactive Notebook**: Explore the `online-payment-fraud-detection.ipynb` file to understand the model training and testing process.
2. **Model Integration**: Use the pre-trained `dtmodel.pkl` file for predictions.
3. **Run Interface**: Launch `ui.py` to test fraud detection in an interactive environment.
